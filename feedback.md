Awesome job on this project! I really like the theme and the way your app looks! I would make sure that your images are as low resolution as looks good -- right now they take a long time to download! Your HTML code isn't validating -- you have extra open tags. Make sure to still validate even though you are using EJS. I would also use under_scores or -'s in file names to break up words. I would also use classes instead of id's for CSS and work on DRY-ing up that code! I would also probably nest your routes so that it is easier to access the parent and child elements together more easily. Again, good job on this project!
