## Project 2 Proposal:

I would like to create an application that allows the user to create and store character information for each of their stories/games. When writing a story, there can be a LOT of different characters to keep track of and I wanted to make an application that lets the user sort characters by the story that theyâ€™re in as well as have a way to keep track of multiple stories. Each story will have multiple characters but each character will only have one story. 

##Project #2 Models(for MVP):
(I may add additional properties once the MVP is working such as an image link, and possibly relations to other characters within the database)

###Story table:
Title: 
Genre:
Setting: (will have the time period or location the story is taking place in)
Year:(year story was created)

###Character table:
FirstName:
LastName:
Alias:
Gender:
Age:(current age)
Prof: (profession)
Desc: (physical description of the character)
Background: (character backstory field)
Image(added field to add URL after)

##Product Features for MVP:
Complete CRUD functionality for both story and characters
Application shows all the stories created, when selected, brings you to the story details where you can edit or delete

##Gold product:
Navigation panel within all views to select the different stories and characters within the stories as well as jump to the add menu for both stories and characters

##User story:
